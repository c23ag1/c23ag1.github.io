	<p>One of the problems with my website was that my divs were appearing vertically, instead of left to right. I went onto stack overflow to figure out what was the problem, and they said to put “float: left;” in the css for the div. I did this, but something unexpected happened. My second div dissapeared completely. So, I searched again and learnt that I also need to put “margin-left” in the css for the second div, and I set it to 40%, which was perfect.</p>

	<p>Today I made the website for the new Comp Sci room. One problem I had is that my ping pong table wasn't showing up on the room image, and it was below it. So, I had to change the CSS to left and top instead of changing the margins, and it worked !!!</p>

	<p>Today I made fizz buzz in scratch. I made a variable, and a loop that increases the variable until it reaches 100. Then i made if statements to check if said variable is divisable by three five or fifteen, in which case the cat says fizz and/or buzz. Otherwise, it just displays said variable.

		<p>Today I learned how to use an array and event listener. I made an array of some of the different schools in New york. Then I produced an event listener who listens for if the button gets clicked. I used a random generator to generate a random number, which then chooses a random school to display. Thankfully, this project did not frustrate me.</p>

	Today I was making my soundmaker project, where I had to use event listeners in javascript. That is because each of the divs plays a different sound when clicked. One of the challenges I faced while making this was keeping all the tags and variables organized, because it got very confusing when I named everything the same. This made it very frustrating, but when I cleaned it up, everything made sense.
