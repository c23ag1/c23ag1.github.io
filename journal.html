	<p>One of the problems with my website was that my divs were appearing vertically, instead of left to right. I went onto stack overflow to figure out what was the problem, and they said to put “float: left;” in the css for the div. I did this, but something unexpected happened. My second div dissapeared completely. So, I searched again and learnt that I also need to put “margin-left” in the css for the second div, and I set it to 40%, which was perfect.</p>

	<p>Today I made the website for the new Comp Sci room. One problem I had is that my ping pong table wasn't showing up on the room image, and it was below it. So, I had to change the CSS to left and top instead of changing the margins, and it worked !!!</p>
